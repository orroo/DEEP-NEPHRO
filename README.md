# DEEP_NEPHRO: AI-Powered Dialysis Monitoring and Optimization System

> A smart and scalable system for enhancing dialysis care through intelligent monitoring, clinical decision support, and treatment optimization.  
> Developed as part of an academic project at **Esprit School of Engineering**.

---

## 🩺 Overview

**DEEP_NEPHRO** is a university project from **Esprit School of Engineering** that aims to revolutionize dialysis treatment using artificial intelligence and real-time data processing. The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals by monitoring patients during dialysis sessions, predicting optimal session duration and frequency, and providing early warnings of patient deterioration.

By combining medical knowledge, machine learning, and web technologies, DEEP_NEPHRO helps deliver personalized and efficient dialysis care while reducing resource waste.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DEEP_NEPHRO.git
cd DEEP_NEPHRO
```

2. **Set up Python environment and install dependencies**:
```bash
Set up Python backend:
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Django backend with Daphne (ASGI server)**:
```bash
cd project
daphne project.asgi:application
```

5. **Run the Flask app (if included as a microservice)**:
```bash
cd ../"flask app"
python app.py
```
6. **Run The IoT Data Updating Script**:
```bash
cd ../biosignals_fb_to_mat_file-main
pip install -r requirements.txt  // dependencies first
python fb2mat_synth.py
```
